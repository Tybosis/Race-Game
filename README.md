Race-Game
=========

Race against the rabbit project 9/14/2014

This project is a continuation of a racing simulation built in class.  I used the same core mechanics to make the game, creating a Racer object and giving each racer unique name, speed, and focus parameters.  I also included a function to allow the user to play again as many times as they want after completing the race one time.

For this assignment I used the javascript book as a reference on how to create objects with the correct syntax and using the this keyword.
